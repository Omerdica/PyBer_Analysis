# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview
As a new employee at PyBer we are given a new project to help better understand how the ride-sharing data can be used in the future. In this project we are using data from 2019 to help create new summary dataframes and come up with a chart to help understand what changes need to be made in order for the company to be successfull. Our work will help V. Isualize and her colleagues get a better understanding of how each city type operated based on the count of drivers and fares. 

# Results

While looking at the pyber_summary we can see that Urban had the highest amount of earnings out of the three city types. This has to do with the fact that Urban has the most drivers, almost five time the amount of drivers of Suburban city type and nearly thirty times more drivers then Rural. However; when we start to compare the the Avergae Fare Per Ride we see that both Rural and Suburban were charging more per ride and per driver compared to the Urban which had the lowest amount for both Ride and Driver.

As we look at the data above it gives us more of clarification to better understand the Pyber Fare Summary chart and how it seems that Urban is the money making area for the PyBer Ride-Sharing App.
